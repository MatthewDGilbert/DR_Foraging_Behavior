# DATA
FORAGING BEHAVIOR OF CO-OCCURRING NEOTROPICAL RESIDENTS AND NON-BREEDING MIGRANTS, A PILOT STUDY IN PUNTA CANA

### raw_data.csv
This data frame consists of our raw field data, including notes, information about flocking behavior, coordinates, time, observers, playback information, etc. Since much of this data was not used in our personal analysis, other files have more condensed data which is organized from this original file. 

### 0_Full_Dataset.csv
This data frame contains all the rows from raw_data.csv corresponding to our 10 focal species, but keeps only the columns which are relevant to data analysis including: Species, Individual #, Foraging Location, substrate, and technique, Canopy height, and bird height. This is used in all statistical analysis throughout scripts 2-4.
