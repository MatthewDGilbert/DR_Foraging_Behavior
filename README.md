## Abstract

Niche partitioning, the division of resources among co-occurring species in a community to reduce interspecific competition, is an evolutionary process which has been the subject of intensive study in birds. It has been particularly well-studied in the New World Warbler family (Parulidae) since MacArthur's landmark study of breeding warblers in the United States. However, competition on warblers' wintering (non-breeding) grounds has received relatively little attention, especially regarding the effect that migrants have on resident species. We hypothesized that partitioning through foraging behavior would exist among and between insectivorous migrant and resident species at our study site in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. We gathered standardized behavioral data on eight wintering migrant warbler species as well as two resident insectivores, Broad-billed Tody (Todus subulatus) and Black-Whiskered Vireo (Vireo altiloquus). For each foraging attempt, we recorded data on the foraging height, technique type, substrate type, habitat type, as well as notes on social behavior. Only one of the 45 possible pairings of our study species showed overlap across all variables we investigated. Resident species differed from migrants and each other by foraging technique (predominantly flycatching and/or including berries in their diet). Among the migrant species, which primarily gleaned for insects, we observed differences in foraging substrate for all but one species. Our results suggest that there are low levels of ongoing interspecific competition in this community and that niche partitioning exists among residents, among migrants, and between migrants and residents. These findings provide insight into how migrant and resident birds seasonally coexist and lays the basis for biologically-mindful conservation work in the community.
