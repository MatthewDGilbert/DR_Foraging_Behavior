## Abstract

Niche partitioning, the division of resources among co-occurring species in a community to reduce interspecific competition, is an evolutionary process which has been the subject of intensive study in birds, particularly in the New World Warbler family (Parulidae), since MacArthur's landmark study of breeding warblers in the United States. However, competition on warblers' wintering (non-breeding) grounds has received relatively little attention. We hypothesized that partitioning through foraging behavior would exist among insectivorous migrants and resident species at our study site in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. We gathered standardized behavioral data on eight wintering migrant wood-warbler species as well as two resident insectivores, Broad-billed Tody (Todus subulatus) and Black-Whiskered Vireo (Vireo altiloquus). Our results suggest that these species are able to coexist through niche differentiation by a combination of prey procurement method, foraging height, and foraging substrate. Groups of species fell into distinct foraging height classes, and differentiated by foraging method within these strata. Resident species differed from migrants by eating berries or predominantly flycatching, while the migrants, which primarily gleaned for insects, partitioned by foraging on different substrates. These findings lay the basis of biologically-mindful conservation work of this group in the Dominican Republic, as well as laying the groundwork for future investigation into the possible presence of seasonal ecological release when migrants are absent.
