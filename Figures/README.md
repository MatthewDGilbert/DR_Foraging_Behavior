FORAGING BEHAVIOR OF CO-OCCURRING NEOTROPICAL RESIDENTS AND NON-BREEDING MIGRANTS, A PILOT STUDY IN PUNTA CANA

## Main Text Plots

**Figure 1**: Plot of means and 95% confidence intervals for canopy height (m) and proportional bird height within canopy (bird height / canopy height) for each migrant and resident species. Species abbreviations are as follows: BBTO – Broad-billed Tody, BWVI – Black-whiskered Vireo, PAWA – Palm Warbler, YRWA – Yellow-rumped Warbler, OVEN – Ovenbird, PRAW – Prairie Warbler, NOPA – Northern Parula, BAWW – Black-and-white Warbler, AMRE – American Redstart, CMWA – Cape May Warbler. Due to varying sample size, the width of confidence intervals in figures does not represent the breadth of the niche, just the confidence in the mean value. 


**Figure 2A:** Stacked bar plot for ratios of observed foraging attack techniques between species. 

**Figure 2B:** Results of pairwise Fisher’s exact tests for significant differences in ratios of foraging attack techniques observed. P-values are adjusted for multiple comparisons with Bonferroni.   

**Figure 3A:** Stacked Bar Plot showing the proportion of foraging attempts made on/from each substrate classification by species.  

**Figure 3B:** Results of pairwise Fisher’s exact tests for significant differences in ratios of foraging substrates observed. P-values are adjusted for multiple comparisons with Bonferroni. Because residents show clear differences in foraging technique (see figure 2B), only pairwise comparisons between migrant warblers are shown.

**Figure 4:** Minimum pairwise Pianka overlap across all four examined dimensions of foraging niche (technique, substrate, proportional height, canopy height at foraging location). A value of 1 indicates identical proportions of shared categories, while a value of 0 indicates no sharing of categories. Overlap proportions are calculated using up to five foraging attempts per individual. 


## Supplemental Information

**Figure S1:** Map of the Dominican Republic, with La Altagracia, Punta Cana, with the boundaries of the study area marked.

**Figure S2:** Box plot showing the stratification of foraging height within the canopy for each focal species. Each point represents the height at which the foraging attack occurred. 

**Figure S3:** Pianka overlap in foraging technique calculated for all species-by-species pairwise comparisons. A value of 1 indicates identical proportions of shared categories, while a value of 0 indicates no sharing of categories. Overlap proportions are calculated using up to five foraging attempts per individual. 

**Figure S4:** Standardized effect size (SES) for Pianka niche overlap in foraging technique relative to null expectations, calculated using bootstrap. Each cell shows the SES for a species pair, calculated as (observed overlap - μnull) / σnull. Colors indicate the magnitude and direction of deviation from the null model (blue = lower overlap than expected; red = higher overlap than expected), with colors below -2 or above 2 clipped to convey significant partitioning or convergence. Numeric values denote un-clipped SES. Grey cells indicate missing or undefined comparisons.

**Figure S5:** Pianka overlap in foraging substrate calculated for all species-by-species pairwise comparisons. A value of 1 indicates identical proportions of shared categories, while a value of 0 indicates no sharing of categories. Overlap proportions are calculated using up to five foraging attempts per individual. 

**Figure S6:** Standardized effect size (SES) for Pianka niche overlap in foraging substrate relative to null expectations, calculated using bootstrap. Each cell shows the SES for a species pair, calculated as (observed overlap - μnull) / σnull. Colors indicate the magnitude and direction of deviation from the null model (blue = lower overlap than expected; red = higher overlap than expected), with colors below -2 or above 2 clipped to convey significant partitioning or convergence. Numeric values denote un-clipped SES. Grey cells indicate missing or undefined comparisons.

**Figure S7: **Pianka overlap in foraging heights calculated for all species-by-species pairwise comparisons. Heights are divided into four classes: 0-25% (understory), 25-50% (lower midstory), 50-75% (upper midstory), and 75-100% (upperstory). A value of 1 indicates identical proportions of shared categories, while a value of 0 indicates no sharing of categories. Overlap proportions are calculated using up to five foraging attempts per individual. 

**Figure S8: **Standardized effect size (SES) for Pianka niche overlap in proportional foraging height relative to null expectations, calculated using bootstrap. Heights are divided into four classes: 0-25% (understory), 25-50% (lower midstory), 50-75% (upper midstory), and 75-100% (upperstory). Each cell shows the SES for a species pair, calculated as (observed overlap - μnull) / σnull. Colors indicate the magnitude and direction of deviation from the null model (blue = lower overlap than expected; red = higher overlap than expected), with colors below -2 or above 2 clipped to convey significant partitioning or convergence. Numeric values denote un-clipped SES. Grey cells indicate missing or undefined comparisons.

**Figure S9:** Pianka overlap in canopy heights at foraging locations calculated for all species-by-species pairwise comparisons. Canopy heights are divided into five classes: 0-5m, 5-7.5m, 7.5-10m, 10-12.5m, >12.5m. A value of 1 indicates identical proportions of shared categories, while a value of 0 indicates no sharing of categories. Overlap proportions are calculated using up to five foraging attempts per individual. 

**Figure S10:** Standardized effect size (SES) for Pianka niche overlap in canopy height relative to null expectations, calculated using bootstrap. Canopy heights are divided into five classes: 0-5m, 5-7.5m, 7.5-10m, 10-12.5m, >12.5m. Each cell shows the SES for a species pair, calculated as (observed overlap - μnull) / σnull. Colors indicate the magnitude and direction of deviation from the null model (blue = lower overlap than expected; red = higher overlap than expected), with colors below -2 or above 2 clipped to convey significant partitioning or convergence. Numeric values denote un-clipped SES. Grey cells indicate missing or undefined comparisons.
