FORAGING BEHAVIOR OF CO-OCCURRING NEOTROPICAL RESIDENTS AND NON-BREEDING MIGRANTS MAY REVEAL NICHE DIFFERENTIATION

## Main Text Plots

**Figure 1**: Plot of means and 95% confidence intervals for canopy height (m) and proportional bird height within canopy (bird height / canopy height) for each migrant and resident species. Species abbreviations are as follows: BBTO – Broad-billed Tody, BWVI – Black-whiskered Vireo, PAWA – Palm Warbler, YRWA – Yellow-rumped Warbler, OVEN – Ovenbird, PRAW – Prairie Warbler, NOPA – Northern Parula, BAWW – Black-and-white Warbler, AMRE – American Redstart, CMWA – Cape May Warbler. Due to varying sample size, the width of confidence intervals in figures does not represent the breadth of the niche, just the confidence in the mean value. 


**Figure 2A:** Stacked bar plot for ratios of observed foraging attack techniques between species. 

**Figure 2B:** Results of pairwise Fisher’s exact tests for significant differences in ratios of foraging attack techniques observed. P-values are adjusted for multiple comparisons with Bonferroni.   

**Figure 3A:** Stacked Bar Plot showing the proportion of foraging attempts made on/from each substrate classification by species.  

**Figure 3B:** Results of pairwise Fisher’s exact tests for significant differences in ratios of foraging substrates observed. P-values are adjusted for multiple comparisons with Bonferroni. Because residents show clear differences in foraging technique (see figure 2B), only pairwise comparisons between migrant warblers are shown.



## Supplemental Information

**Figure S1:** Map of the Dominican Republic, with La Altagracia, Punta Cana, with the boundaries of the study area marked.

**Figure S2:** Box plot showing the stratification of foraging height within the canopy for each focal species. Each point represents the height at which the foraging attack occurred.
