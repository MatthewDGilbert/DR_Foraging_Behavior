FORAGING BEHAVIOR OF CO-OCCURRING NEOTROPICAL RESIDENTS AND NON-BREEDING MIGRANTS, A PILOT STUDY IN PUNTA CANA

## Main Text Plots

Figure 1: Product of pairwise Pianka overlaps across all four examined dimensions of foraging niche (technique, substrate, proportional height, canopy height at foraging location). A value of 1 indicates identical proportions of shared categories, while a value of 0 indicates no sharing in at least one category. Indices calculated using a maximum of five foraging attempts per individual. Species acronyms follow the six-letter codes for scientific names, as in Table 1.


Figure 2: Mean values and 95% confidence intervals for canopy height (m) and proportional bird height within canopy (bird height / canopy height) for each migrant and resident species. Because sample size varies by species, the width of the confidence intervals in the figures does not represent the breadth of the niche, but only the confidence interval for the mean value. Confidence intervals calculated using the bootstrap. Species acronyms follow the six-letter codes for scientific names, as in Table 1.

Figure 3: Observed foraging attempt technique type for each species. Resident species are bolded. (A): stacked bar plot with observed proportions per species; (B): Pianka overlap in `	foraging technique between species. A value of 1 indicates identical proportions of shared categories, while a value of 0 indicates no sharing of categories. Species acronyms follow the six-letter codes for scientific names, as in Table 1.

Figure 4: Observed foraging attempt substrate types for each species. Resident species are bolded. (A): stacked bar plot showing the observed proportions of substrate per species; (B): Pianka overlap in foraging substrate between species. A value of 1 indicates identical proportions of shared categories, while a value of 0 indicates no sharing of categories.  Species acronyms follow the six-letter codes for scientific names, as in Table 1.

## Supplemental Information

**Figure S1:** Map of the Dominican Republic, with La Altagracia, Punta Cana, with the boundaries of the study area marked.

Figure S2: Boxplot showing the stratification of proportional foraging height within the canopy for each focal species. Each point represents the height at which a foraging attempt occurred. Whiskers represent the range of non-outlier values, and black dots show raw data points. Boxplots were created using ggplot2 defaults following Tukey (1977). Species acronyms follow the six-letter codes for scientific names, as in Table 1.

Figure S3: Boxplot showing the stratification of actual foraging height for each focal species. Each point represents the height at which a foraging attempt occurred. Whiskers represent the range of non-outlier values, and black dots show raw data points. Boxplots were created using ggplot2 defaults following Tukey (1977). Species acronyms follow the six-letter codes for scientific names, as in Table 1.

Figure S4: Pianka overlap in foraging heights calculated for all species-by-species pairwise comparisons. Heights were divided into four classes: 0–20% (understory), 21–46% (lower midstory), 47–71% (upper midstory), and 72–100% (upperstory). A value of 1 indicates identical proportional use across categories, while a value of 0 indicates no overlap in proportional use of foraging heights. Indices were calculated using a maximum of five foraging attempts per individual. Species acronyms follow the six-letter codes for scientific names, as in Table 1.

Figure S5: Pianka overlap index for canopy heights at foraging locations calculated for all species-by-species pairwise comparisons. Canopy heights are divided into five classes: 1–3 m, 4-7 m, 8-10 m, 11–13 m, 14-17 m. A value of 1 indicates identical proportional use of the canopy height bins, while a value of 0 indicates no overlap in proportional use of canopy heights. Indices were calculated using a maximum of five foraging attempts per individual. Species acronyms follow the six-letter codes for scientific names, as in Table 1.

Figure S6: Significance of between-species comparisons of the ratios of most frequent foraging attempt techniques used by each individual. P-values are calculated between all species pairs using Fisher’s exact tests without correction, as global significance tests (PERMANOVA p<0.001) showed strong global significance. Species acronyms follow the six-letter codes for scientific names, as in Table 1.
